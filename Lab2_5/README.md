## SEP200 - Lab 5: A Company Database

This lab will test your ability to use templates as a means of parametric polmorphism.

This week you are going to use templates with parametric polmorphism to build two company databases - one for regular employees and one for executives. The function prototypes for accessing these databases are identical. What these functions do and the type of data they take are different.
