## SEP200 - Lab 6: A Sports Association
This lab will test your ability to use aggregation, enumerations, and overriding of operators.

A sports association is going to contain an aggregate of sports teams. In our lab, there are two types of sports teams - a hockey team and a baseball team. A hockey team will keep track of a team's wins, losses, ties and will calculate points based on these. A baseball team will keep track of a team's wins and losses and will calculate a winning percentage based on these (percentage in the context of baseball is a number between 0.000 and 1.000).

The main sports association program will create one sports association and add teams to it based on user input.
