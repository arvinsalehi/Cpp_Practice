## SEP200 - Lab 4: A Packet Parser
This program parses a network packet. This packet could be of type UDP or type TCP. Generally speaking, UDP is for unreliable but fast communications, and TCP is for reliable but slower communications. Each packet has its own format. This has been described in detail in PacketParserMain.cpp. Both parsers will accept a packet of type char* and parse and store relevant information from that packet. Both parsers will also provide a report to an output stream. The function prototypes can be found in the base class PacketParser.h.
